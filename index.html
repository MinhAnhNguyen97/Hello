  <p> omg no more confusing please. Procedings stuffs may be taken with a grain of salt. But you are also right wing right? And sorry if I was confusing. It hurt being fooled (kind of) before. Took years to heal (mostly heal from my own delusion but). It, They really took hold of my well being. Anyways, I feel like real encounters are really difficult cause we as different sex have nothing to talk about but just work (and plans for the future :)). But if any chance of a cool/chill first encounter or texting YOU want is fine. I am trying to make something that will click(superficially)  between us for others/the whole world to agree with but nowhere yet. Also, the age gap is annoying (cause you are still young and I am growing old) and I think people gonna talk. I don't have much of a sense of humor so I borrow it from friends. My personal obsession is clothing, which I think you have no interest in. I think we can bond over complaints of the world reallly. I hope this doesn't bother you, my dear. </p>
  <p> =.= </p>  
  <p> I was going to study today but mom said I can go out so now i don't want to study ;_; </p>
  <p> Uhm, I feel like I'm oVeR sharing here but. U share. Ahn is actually the letters in the Hangul? alphabet system of Korean language. When I make the gmail, ngminhanh is taken so i use ahn instead...</p>
