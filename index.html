  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP6LQjJo7eY </p>
  <p> omg no more confusing please. Procedings stuffs may be taken with a grain of salt. But you are also right wing right? And sorry if I was confusing. It hurt being fooled (kind of) before. Took years to heal (mostly heal from my own delusion but). It, They really took hold of my well being. Anyways, I feel like real encounters are really difficult cause we as different sex have nothing to talk about but just work (and plans for the future :)). But if any chance of a cool/chill first encounter or texting YOU want is fine. I am trying to make something that will click(superficially)  between us for others/the whole world to agree with but nowhere yet. Also, the age gap is annoying (cause you are still young and I am growing old) and I think people gonna talk. I don't have much of a sense of humor so I borrow it from friends. My personal obsession is clothing, which I think you have no interest in. I think we can bond over complaints of the world reallly. I hope this doesn't bother you, my dear. </p>
  <p> =.= </p>  
  <p> Uhm, I feel like I'm oVeR sharing here but. U share. Ahn is actually the letters in the Hangul? alphabet system of Korean language. When I make the gmail, ngminhanh is taken so i use ahn instead...</p>
  <p> I will be like very busy this week! Will you be in DC this summer or anywhere? </p>
  <p> so u r saying goodbye??? ;_; 9 </p>
  <p> Y u keep demanding the truth from me... üëç </p>

  <p> IiIii waunt a date! </p>
  <p> I had kind of a busy day today, running errands? Good Night :33 </p>
  <p> Hello hello , am trying to get in the grrind, which is always very messy and confusing but WatTeVErz. Do u want a trip to Vietnam? I remember you are Irish, Dutch but then can't remember the other 2. Is it Italian and Portuguese? But I've been thinking, are u sure you kind of work for Homeland Security and for American government and people. Is there a place for us? Also, I really really want to stay here but that's depen-dent on whether I can find job or not. However, a strategy I use back home is "n√≥i tr∆∞·ªõc b∆∞·ªõc kh√¥ng qua", so one can't say to success it before you made it there.</p>
  <p> lookin(g) for a bracelet to wear always </p>  
  <p> :3 </p>
  <p> *nod* is guilty of buying too many things </p>
  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXaanDHENI </p>
  <p> what did you do today?! </p>
  <p> aneeways if u want to hear me rant on a normal day sunday evening </p>
  <p> I went out today to get some frilly socks because I need a purpose to put in some steps. I plan to go there H&M by metro then walk home. I got there and the place wasn't open so I have to walk to the other H&M which is at Georgetown. I got there and the socks materials was terrible and the frills don't look good. But cause I already walk there, I look for some summer clothes. I got an on sale Athleta shirt, whose materials very light and airy  but is polyester and a Alo Yoga shorts, which was not on sale. The short is ...a bit really short but I think it is a nice short for summer cause it looks fancy in my opinion. But I hope I can wear it often, if not, may return it cause too short making people cat-calling for that... I wore a sleeve-less lemon print with white bows in the back (just received from Hanoi) and these black people is overly chatty with me, calling me 'sweethearts', looking at me. Very uncomfortable... But I still want to keep the shorts!!! </p>
  <p> andddd, cause you're kind of here. Which is better: I got the  68$ shorts but now i look online, there is this 78$ version. The 68 perks is have longer inseam and zipped pocket but the 78$ have layers so look more techno. But i think the 78 would look better on someone who have actual athletic thighs, legs. Not sure but 68 might be better cause less detail. </p>
  <p> good next week! </p>
  <p> but :B </p>

  <p> Hello! I'm done with my room cleaning! Let's hope I can start with making proofs and stuffs. Also, guilt bought this today... https://www.target.com/p/lego-icons-10369/-/A-90863999#lnk=sametab Orgininally want to buy this one https://www.target.com/p/lego-icons-10368/-/A-90864002#lnk=sametab but look a bit creepy. Sowee... </p>
  <p> LOL, me curious, never met a random history student before, only met one from Vietnam that is best of best who studied East Asian history in Harvard & Columbia. And unfortunately, he look like one of the statue of a boy I live draw while in Vietnam, but I don't really partake in such activities anymore... And yes, I think i do streamline?/ separate people by their looks...Not very good but every else things are taken by people who are better than me at it so there is nothing else I can do (back then). Also, kust really don't know how things work in America, only know that the country get a lot of money from WWII!! At home, exclusive things are only for the top and super rich and if not engineer, doctor, gov administrations, and business? there are absolutely very little funding. I just don't know how America can afford funding for stuffs like art, social studies, histories, etc. Land of opportunities I guess. Also, there is another ban on new student visa :(</p>
