  <p> Heyo, cutest!!!! </p>
  <p> 👍 </p>
  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP6LQjJo7eY </p>
  <p> omg no more confusing please. Procedings stuffs may be taken with a grain of salt. But you are also right wing right? And sorry if I was confusing. It hurt being fooled (kind of) before. Took years to heal (mostly heal from my own delusion but). It, They really took hold of my well being. Anyways, I feel like real encounters are really difficult cause we as different sex have nothing to talk about but just work (and plans for the future :)). But if any chance of a cool/chill first encounter or texting YOU want is fine. I am trying to make something that will click(superficially)  between us for others/the whole world to agree with but nowhere yet. Also, the age gap is annoying (cause you are still young and I am growing old) and I think people gonna talk. I don't have much of a sense of humor so I borrow it from friends. My personal obsession is clothing, which I think you have no interest in. I think we can bond over complaints of the world reallly. I hope this doesn't bother you, my dear. </p>
  <p> =.= </p>  
  <p> Uhm, I feel like I'm oVeR sharing here but. U share. Ahn is actually the letters in the Hangul? alphabet system of Korean language. When I make the gmail, ngminhanh is taken so i use ahn instead...</p>
  <p> I will be like very busy this week! Will you be in DC this summer or anywhere? </p>

  <p> I had kind of a busy day today, running errands? Good Night :33 </p>
  <p> Hello hello , am trying to get in the grrind, which is always very messy and confusing but WatTeVErz. Do u want a trip to Vietnam? I remember you are Irish, Dutch but then can't remember the other 2. Is it Italian and Portuguese? But I've been thinking, are u sure you kind of work for Homeland Security and for American government and people. Is there a place for us? Also, I really really want to stay here but that's depen-dent on whether I can find job or not. However, a strategy I use back home is "nói trước bước không qua", so one can't say to success it before you made it there.</p>
  <p> lookin(g) for a bracelet to wear always </p>  
  <p> :3 </p>
  <p> *nod* is guilty of buying too many things </p>
  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXaanDHENI </p>
  <p> what did you do today?! </p>
  <p> aneeways if u want to hear me rant on a normal day sunday evening </p>
  <p> I went out today to get some frilly socks because I need a purpose to put in some steps. I plan to go there H&M by metro then walk home. I got there and the place wasn't open so I have to walk to the other H&M which is at Georgetown. I got there and the socks materials was terrible and the frills don't look good. But cause I already walk there, I look for some summer clothes. I got an on sale Athleta shirt, whose materials very light and airy  but is polyester and a Alo Yoga shorts, which was not on sale. The short is ...a bit really short but I think it is a nice short for summer cause it looks fancy in my opinion. But I hope I can wear it often, if not, may return it cause too short making people cat-calling for that... I wore a sleeve-less lemon print with white bows in the back (just received from Hanoi) and these black people is overly chatty with me, calling me 'sweethearts', looking at me. Very uncomfortable... But I still want to keep the shorts!!! </p>
  <p> andddd, cause you're kind of here. Which is better: I got the  68$ shorts but now i look online, there is this 78$ version. The 68 perks is have longer inseam and zipped pocket but the 78$ have layers so look more techno. But i think the 78 would look better on someone who have actual athletic thighs, legs. Not sure but 68 might be better cause less detail. </p>
  <p> good next week! </p>
  <p> but :B </p>
  <p> 🤪 </p>

Sowee... </p>
  <p> LOL, me curious, never met a random history student before, only met one from Vietnam that is best of best who studied East Asian history in Harvard & Columbia. And unfortunately, he look like one of the statue of a boy I live draw while in Vietnam, but I don't really partake in such activities anymore (because it's no longer useful in what I am trying to achieve?) And yes, I think i do streamline?/ separate people by their looks (wink wink)...Not very good but every else things are taken by people who are better than me at it so there is nothing else I can do (back then). Also, really don't know how things work in America, only know that the country get a lot of money from WWII!! At home, exclusive things are only for the top and super rich and if not engineer, doctor, gov administrations, and business? there are absolutely very little funding. I don't know how America can afford funding for stuffs like art, social studies, histories, etc, which is great! Andd, there is another ban on new student visa :(</p>
  <p> Ya, i'll tell you about me a bit later todey. Can u please share you pasttt plese too?</p>
  <p> Agein, salt.</p>
  <p> So, my decision for high school is to idolize everything and everyone, which helps me with some problem solving but was really bad with making friends, because I couldn’t find people who are like me and end up idolize everyone (which was not too bad cause the high school have really good demographic). I was able And I like solving problems that people just kind of mention to me, problems that can be ‘only’ be solved (fast) with my perspective on life and things (solving it only by saying sth that first come into mind…) 
The high school I went for is really good and famous. I failed to get in it for secondary school and my fam was kind of disappointed. So I tried again for high school and made it, but not to the English class but the Chinese class (so English 1, English 2, Chinese and Russian all took the same test but grades are descending. The school is really active, have a lot of extracurricular activities cause its main focus is really to study abroad. But like after getting into the school, I was so depressed cause I keep thinking that I want to get into math classes. So, being stupid, I completely disregard studying Chinese and become a depressed student and I skip school a lot. And so I met Trang, a journalist who studied in University of Chicago. Her perspective on life at that point is like mine, kind of emo but more experienced and way more antisocial (but she is really intelligent). So she got me into reading philosophies and drawing but the material is so dense that I procrastinate a lot. And the moral of the story is to be creative and really hold to the stuffs that moves you. So, everything idea was kind of in relation to some math/physics.
Aside from that, so my crush from elementary school is (idolizedd) really smart, he was the reason why I think I am so stupid often. He is in my high school too and end up winning a bunch of gold medals from IPHO, which is International Physics Olympiad. And I try so hard to negate him from my life. Then I realize people’s trajectories are different than mine and comparing really did not make total sense (but I compare anyway). In the mess of every field of study (cause I can’t tell one a part from another), I was like a so so student. But thank goodness, I was able to get scholarships (have to pay 7k per term, there are 2 terms) and went to Bennington College here in the US (after 1 gap year).
I spent a lot of time drawing and reading many types of text(philosophy, psychology, poetry etc) while there, an A+ in drawing/painting and so so B B+ in all other class. Trang told me to go for any class that I liked so I did just that. Again, math crawled up again. Take me 2 extra years to switch back to math. And then my fam moved here in 2020. So, after done with college I moved here with them. And now I’m here. :3 #lonelysquad
Hop wee get to talk IRL :/ :33

You want innovation, money, housemaid(not included), friend? Tell me whyyyy you'd like to stick around? I stick around cause OMG an American Boy who have some interests in merh, likes learning (motto learn everyday), is cute, responsible, a bit too young (but try act olld and who don't like youth?) and is not a crazy sexually active monster! :3 </p>
  <p> :3 might need one of these... https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tNSjkqtwwnM </p>
  <p> 👍👍 </p>
  <p> Au-ch ark-k-k-k </p>

  <p> rEaLly want to buy this but so Expensive!! https://www.jenniferbehr.com/collections/bobby-pins/products/kara-hair-clips-rose?variant=Rose& Do you think Pool or Rose is a better color?! Maybe I can give mom one. But probably should not buy!!!! Still...Pool or Rose?!</p>
  <p> 👉👈 Okiie, it's a lot of money, like 2 weeks of food supplies. I'lll just let it float in my brain for more times! </p>
  <p> blap blap blap Anyways!!!! Good Monday tomorrow!!!! Also, do you think we can say that what AI outputs are meaningless (eventhough the content is correct/meaningful) because itself doesn't have/create its own purpose...? </p>
  <p> :3 </p>
  <p> 👍 NeED a cotton tshirt though </p>
  <p> U know... my mom is the kind of person that will do anything for family, like basically she sacrificed everything of hers to earn money to raise us. I don't know if I can be or should be so yet! I don't want to stop studying and probably can yet get job that just pays! Myyy dad is a work person in tech in general... Probably should just focus on the now day by day... </p>
  <p> A friend just busted his jaw crashing into a electric pole back home! He lost 16 teeths. So sad! Also...(always late), i think motion is a property of materials, like rocks/stones also have atoms structure that make it into different form (liquid and gas?) according to different temprature? Also, is Atlantic a good news source?! Also, Austrian school shooting, do you think people who commit school shooting are always mentally ill? How could one wants to take away other people's lives? Maybe It's because they view their own life as too miserable? </p>
  <p> #against war. But sad to admit that I too sometimes was a nightmare of a person during high school and college.</p>
  <p> :p I prob should stop borrowing from others.... But I neEd to thinkkkkk and goal is to surpass a line of thought then to display the thought (but now, I am still figuring the picture for mathematics. I think I vaguely got the picture for data science...) And today, met someone's dad. honestly fell a little on edge when people spend more money and seems to live life better/ more technologically advanced/ more yolo than us. But that's should be peripheral matter... Best scenerio is to not have to translate from one concept to another and probably take responsible for myYy actions. But how to determine one's 'independent'action right? But agaain, :3 How are u tOdAy?! </p>
  <p> #jobless wink wink and side track-ed </p>
  <p> find this weird liquid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMj7YdCfYos&t=116s . Also, do you know why when water is draining through the drain (which have small holes?), they create like a tornado spiral instead of just drain like we pour liquid? </p>
  <p> Visual abit too much but music's fine? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jL0vy2YaDg </p>
  <p> Aneeways, I think we're not getting any (not like anyone is getting anything mean me) cause I need to lose at least 3kg but unable to do soo for like 3 years. And not surre wweight loss should be the focal point here too! </p>
  <p> :3 </p>

And they can't get info about me entering the US with that passport. After a while they asked about my previous passport and I gave them the number and I was cleared. Made the whole group wait for 30 minutes...</p>

  <p> *side eyes and a cute pout*, fireworks yay! a car yay! would not be able to save to buy a car aka me? And I guess I'm also trying to figure out the saying 'you drive like a women' mean! Do so for the goods of other people really, and for my own underStAndIng. And, OK, I'm too old to be slacking yes... ? :33 No beard please/plese :B </p>

  <p> Im a bit confused. So you're thinking about insurances?! Who are these top providers again? I'd love to be provided for but it's 2025! Aside from finding the impossible aka job. I should be able to firsly partially provide for myself somehow? Do you plan to stay here in DC for a while right? Or do you want to hop around? If I can find a job, I would 'kill' for a move in situation :) </p>
  <p> Agein... What's integrityretire mean? Yes, so you want a life with fidelity and service? For Service, so you want to spend AlL your life for someone else/your nation and not yourself and close people around you? So, you want to live with an ideal? For fidelity, short answar YES. But i'm sleepy right now (spent all day studying woohoo)! But there's many things to learn. 3 take awaysssss: it's what you do, not what you said. And a random quote: statistics makes it so that you can't say you're certain' 'We learn and we come back stronger than before (taken from a car add...)'</p>
  <p> SuperGoopnight!</p>
  <p> I know this is not your expertise but. So this guy, boyfriend of a friend also study Machine Learning and etc. The paper he wrote, though I don't know all cause my field is not autonomous vehicles, shows that he understand the math theorem that is the basis of such algorithms as well as have a new idea on how to tweak the algorithms to produce better results. https://www.facebook.com/share/1Bbtza4KUG/ HHHix, I think I will try work harder! It will take a long time though, because he worked hard since high school and university! Ergh. I still want to try wake up early first :(( </p>

  <p> Fave artist Tomma Abts, if I can get my art career to be longer, I'd move in that direction. When study art, I was always about the now, never know the importance of history at all! But anyways, that road was meaningless because I really don't want to put my emotions onto the canvas. I could move to the direction of something metaphysical? but I'm not that 100% so I just shifts back to things like math </p>

  <p> Hello hello. Yes, time is running out! So do you know how to constantly study without sacrificing a social life? I will be making a plan and sharee with u if that's OK. And to continue my study, teacher Hieu suggests me to look into the dude that teaches an open source online course on machine learning in MIT. I believe that is to understand how he teaches, how he set up the problem and how his influences life influences his logic. And, can we ditch the stereotypes? Can we only use it as guidelines? But I want to stay in the US so iff you can show me what Americans are like (food for thoughts) would be great! :x </p>

  <p> Andddd I bought a lipstick! I couldn't by the one with the bigger base cause no shade fits me. And it's name is all like big city like TOKYO, BALI, MONACO etc I tried their shade Rose Tokyo on and it was a bit pale, feel like a confidently naked person would wear that. So, I bought the lipstick with a thiner case in Peony. And it was 7$ cheaper so that's nice. Could get an extra cup of coffee. I hope my buying era will end soon ;_; Also, do want a boyfriend tshirt. Prob gonna get own boyfriend tshirt too smh BUT, it is what it is!! Got up 1 hour earlier today :33 Will continue to improve! </p>

  <p> waunt! to hear one of my favorite song now? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvUg7KLAclA&list=RDgvUg7KLAclA&start_radio=1 And the song I liked here I discovered through a movie, based on a book by Chehkov. I used to like some of his stories a lot cause it tells about the living conditions that have some similarities with my life. However, that movie with the song is kind of weird. It's a love triangle between a poor girl, an elderly man, a middle-aged doctor. She chose the elderly man to escape poverty and find out that he's not that rich? So she cheated with the middled-aged doctor. She then was shot by the elderly man in a hunting accident and died a couple days later. </p>
  <p> idea from places: can we keep The Really messy in our tech closet somehow? </p>

  <p> Low key don't like people who work in big coorporate look down on me =A= Anyways, have 7749 shades of pink... So, I think my family will leave US between April and June next year? I have 15k, which I know is little cause I do spend buying a lot of things. But that should cover a few months of rent. I think for OPT, teacher said it should be paid. But if too desperate, I think he'll let me work unpaid for a bit to buy some times. Gosh, how to find jobs so people stop looking down on me... (just this one Karen?) </p>
  <p> notice the Trump-Putin summit. I don't really follow but the guys in my family do. This is a meme I think Vietnamese make, my uncle give it to us. </p>

I dOn't CaRe.. Also, did not know Tom Cruise is kind of a predator person :( Thandiwe Newton kind of say so. I think she's so beautiful. But I guess should not be TOO soft either. </p>

  <p> In class rn, will give u calendar if that's OK for u I have 2 classes Monday Tuesday 5:10-7:40, teacher Hieu's research project and a side project with some Vietnamese. Also have to find OPT. Also have ECS. Do u need anything through ECS :3. If it's too much for me, I'll quit it because it took me extra 2 hours aside from 4 hour work time each work day to get to school to do the job. Not sure if the job has something to offer ;__; Also omg, the underground part of the metro station near school can hold massive trains over it !</p>
  <p> Also, maybe wE/you can look into the safe options just to know wwat you might be missing out when have time. It's a big deal right? Honestly have no attraction towards them/dem though.. Might need their aLliances? </p> 
  <p> Having kids are expensive!!!! </p>
  <p> Can I buy this shirt ;_; is it worth buying... I think it look kinda chic in black But white is easierrr to wear... https://www.nordstromrack.com/s/derek-lam-10-crosby-aria-pleated-back-crop-shirt/8210866?origin=bag But will make me 50$ more than anticipateed. </p>
  <p> :33 3 </p>
  <p> Byron stopped working at the Pryz...</p>
  <p> I will work for ECS for next week then quit. Will write to Elizabeth and Jacques? about quitting tomorrow.. Can work onn Labor day but no class on that day so don't wan to go to sChul </p>
  <p> Minneapolis shooting, why do people kill children....? </p>
  <p> A friend discouraged me for finding jobs for OPT ;__; I will continue to find jobs. She also advaced to find jobs for administations of CUA. But I just quit ECS so...And the new work system for international students will mostly be based on pay after our 3 year of OPT. Kind of sad. And most important is I need to start making some/any money. So as a plan D (after plan A B C), I might need to come back to the US after Trump time. The democrats have more lenient policies for international students. But that is plan D. Anyways, it'd be... nice if have a place to stay after May next year, can be a housemaid. I plan to work for the CUA prof Hieu for the first year. But pay is irregular or...nonexistent. I wonder if I can also get a teaching certificate during then to apply for teaching jobs if can't research jobs......Oh well, let the right one in. </p>

  <p> NeEd ideas for using machine learning to automate tasks or classify something!! Room's not done, still have some clothes to sort through then dune. </p>

  <p> :B https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3l-ovZQY4M&list=RDy3l-ovZQY4M&start_radio=1 Good night :3 </p>
  <p> Went out for brunch with the girls, still processing, catch u... tonight?</p>
  <p> Sowee, will not go MIA yes.....?</p>
  <p> 20:46 pm :33 Jewellry? Nice :3 OkE :3333 Starting tomorrow, I will try to be consistent with studying *wish me luuck. The brunch was good but make me a bit insecure (but I am fine because they are really nice). One of them (who I know kind of closely) is way richer than me, one of them is pregnant and getting citizenship... I don't have much thing to say but work/knowledge contents, so don't have much tea to spill... I did tell them about uS kind of. But it make me think: I hope we are a good match. Wat if u lose urself or trying to be someone u'r not?! But the conversation is a bit distracting! Also, they showed me some app that are better versions of Tinder... Do you think I should use that as a form of survey...? But the bulk of my personality lies in being kind of inexperienced in relationships in general. If you think it's a good idea, I can try go on dates just to look for survey data on dating trends,spending trends, societal expectations, salary (important!), ancestry impact on living life, etc etc ? But I think it was worth while because now I am looking for some ideas on what do I want machine learning to deal with. Maybe I can make AI algorithms for a human type robot that do things like laundry (don't know if thhat type of robots needs AI though) I can also use machine learning for classification tasks but not sure to classify wat hhhh </p>
  <p> What does 26 means? So, u've gone throught the dating process? So, should I also try that? </p>
  <p> :3 </p>

  <p> Good morning 👉👈 </p>
  <p> My mom is sad and crying and want to go home ;____; #whatabadchildi'vebeen. What to do/say?!! She's a really really really soft person. Probably because our national day is today/tomorrow. It's celebrated really big this year, for 80 years since the birth/declare of socialist republic of Vietnam and 50 years since declare independence. I think she's better now, she was complaining about how she doesn't go to work here but stay home all the time! And she probably was channeling other people's problem, as what she say is i think not her problem at all!!!! THaNK You! Wink wink. Also, want access to the HARD PULL, consistent record. Don't want those people to treat me like an idiot. (But it really does not matter at this point) </p>
  <p> *micelleneous | Stoap Spoiling meeee, I don't have that kind of casssh? *pout !  </p>

  <p> Do you have issues, plese find ways to share as numbers 13 or else makes no sense there (liar liar pants on firre :3)</p>
  <p> Went to sephora today. The guy with a lot of beard and flawless skin coming out almost hit me with the door so I have to rush through him and not back up cause if back up, I will still hit him as he come out because the distance is close. He annoyingly said "thank you very much" to mean that (i think) I should thank him for opening the door. Whatever dude.</p>

Can we preliminary question that the democrats did it (but I heard democrats are less violent) or just some terrible horrible bad atheist?

I am thinking pebble or black with gold logo (leaning towardss the pebble?) or we can look at other options that are bigger... Bought the pebble one. Will ask dad to drive me to Tyson to pick it up!? Values etc? We picked it up today! But what do you think of this color they have at the store?! I think it's more ACTIVE but the pebble one is more classy maybe?! https://www.celine.com/en-us/celine-shop-women/small-leather-goods/coin-and-card-holders/card-holder-triomphe-in-shiny-calfskin-10L833DPV.18AE.html?nav=A002112 </p>

  <p> Stuffs i don't really know: Hello, ...also as a small country, I don't know the motives of using nuclear power bombs (in the past?) to challenge? kill? defeat? take over? one another... Would love to be a bit enlightended there... And have airplanes designs gotten better over the years? :3 </p>
  <p> Let's dream sometimes bro!</p>
  <p> goop night! </p>
  <p> I think the censorships imposed by the president is a bit much! Charlie is painted as someone above others I feel. And all opinions that oppose that is censored?! </p>
  <p> I think I can't step away from pretty things ;__; but will try. </p>

  <p> https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1269039051926751&set=a.334266858737313 Who have extra 100k per year! to pay for H1-B Visa ... It's going to make USA rich but I feel it unjust ... my bro ...;_; "Jorge Lopez, the chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler Mendelson PC, said a $100,000 fee "will put the brakes on American competitiveness in the tech sector and all industries"."</p>
  <p> Ya, dog days starting. </p>
  <p> Also, do you know the strengths of our school (Catholic University of America). I really don't know where to pick up such knowledges. I am looking to see what comprises of different types of institution (kind of..) All I know is they are Catholic and PeOple seems nicer and kind! What do you think of their creativity, where their motivation comes from, their family backgrounds, their friend groups, the school's fundings, etc. So, is being a Catholic the main point of what the school got to offer?! Also, are only excellent people are considered to play a roll in school history... If so, why excellent people choose Catholic (should look into these things before applying to school but my stup-id a$$ never want to do such research :|. </p>
  <p> :B Section SHARE THINGS FROM THE PAST (eee): Not particularly legal but I hope u enjoy just the music alone of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcu1AHaTchM&list=RDJcu1AHaTchM&start_radio=1 </p>

  <p> Will take stalking strangers as something serious!! </p>
  <p> But I think the Republican are nice because some of their values are grounded in like... simple things. While the Democrats are so progressive and liberal, sometimes I feel like I'm left behind? </p>

  <p> Anyways (sorre I know it's just your Monday).., I feel really mean today. So I was in a Hackathon last Saturday and did not win (never win anYthing). This girl in my class today did. It was the same girl who told me to shut up :) So the teacher was like, the winning team worked real hard so I should look up to them kind of. I was like, lol they already win, now u want mE(s) to submit to their victory? Absolutely NO ... I've been thinking of taking sides these days and it do not feel good but have to anyways!! So I can view things more clearly :B :33 </p>
  <p> OKEe, let me try to log onto their monitor/screens (not literally) to find out best rates? Not sure that's possible (rates on like wat things though??) 'Latency', 'kernel' cool (i don't get that). Keep pour city safe your job? OKE ee </p>
  <p> Oke, I see/c? some delivery failure? ...idk (somehow SaME) ...but maybe you can list out exactly what you ll need in the realm? Maybe you don't need ThOsE?. You don't like 2 yes? </p>
  <p> i still like the name Agnes but agein, it's too much?! Or Florence ;__; Or Alexandria ;______; Or Anastasia, Autumn, ... What do you think? :3 i also like Lotte (i thought it's pronouced with the e but not.). Any names between Agnes and Lotte? I need to ask Enrollment Services for names?! Oh, ask them for the next steps I should take in my careers ???? :333 </p>
  <p> aneways, yes, need to be making money. Probably need to be a good person for that yes? IDK. Probably just need to be really good with my crafts. They probably bypass other qualities. </p>
  <p> Ok, been asking things from the wrong person/people </p>

  <p> Hi rich boiiii </p>
  <p> Shooting at Brown University. Also, it's when students are supposed to have finals. </p>
  <p> Soft me just sad. Not sure why such obscene things happen. Again, the crime is too planned out, specific, cruel. What could this person have against the school/the students (read that someone said that that guy targets only students there? and not the community at large)! Need answers. 😢  </p>
  <p> :3 </p>
  <p> Can I get a shirt that is leopard print or stripe? </p>
  <p> The guy that shoots people in Brown, also kill that professor in MIT and was a Brown drop out? </p>
  <p> alternative ok 👍 ... </p>
